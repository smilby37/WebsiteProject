        <p>Our title might be. </p>
        <p> Maegan Jordan and Sandy Milby. We are going to decide together what the basic look of the pages will be and then work seperatly on pages after</p>
        <p> This website could be for a local bakery who wants a website to promote their business. Trying to get community members to support their bakery</p>
        <p>This website is used as a resouce for customers to see what product we have and learn more about the business</p>
        <p> The main features of the webiste are pages that have our products and cakes. Then a page to see what is avaible for big events. Option to order a cake online. Then a page that has our contact info and other info about us</p>
        <p> We estimate to have around 10 pages</p>
        <p> The target audience is familys and by having a somewhat modern feel we'd hope to attract any type of person</p>
        <p>Our design goal is to have a modern feel, its going to look more simple, but in a sleak way</p>
        <p> Technical factors could be that I don't know too much javascript so if there is something else that we want the website to do we muight just not know how</p>
        <p> We are going to work on then all at the same time instead of finishing one at a time</p>
